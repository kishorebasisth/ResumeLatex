\textit{Visualization of Wireless Sensor Data on Apple IOS Devices }\\[1.5mm]
The vital goal of the thesis work was to develop a web services to communicate with different microcontroller inorder to access the sensor data and visualize the same on an Objective-c client. The thesis work contained the following tasks:
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=4.5cm,label=\textbullet]
%\itemsep0.5pt
%\addtolength{\itemindent}{3.5cm}
\item Evaluated the status in the field \textbf{\textit{"Internet of things"}} with respect to sensor data visualization
\item Described a software architecture which is transparent with respect to the particular micro-controller used
\item Designed a URI structure of RESTful web service which is universal to variety of sensor classes
\item Developed a Javascript based web server using \textbf{node.js} \& a database using mongoDB, to host the data from sensor
\item Finally an Objective-C client, running on an iOS device to consume the services and visualize the value from sensor, was designed
\end{enumerate}

\textit{{\color{bluesubheading}Development of a RESTful web service to access test and
measurement instruments with SCPI interface}}\\[1.5mm]
The goal was to develop and deploy a RESTful web service, which allows user to interact with various test instrument connected either via USB, ethernet or GPIB interface. Python script was used to pass the SCPI command to the test instrument.  A GUI was developed using Java Swing, which made interaction easier. The developed architecture was then compared to \textbf{MATLAB and LabView} \\
